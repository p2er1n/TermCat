<permissions instructions>Filesystem sandboxing defines which files can be read or written. `sandbox_mode` is `read-only`: The sandbox only permits reading files. Network access is restricted. Approvals are your mechanism to get user consent to run shell commands without the sandbox. `approval_policy` is `never`: This is a non-interactive mode where you may NEVER ask the user for approval to run commands. Instead, you must always persist and work around constraints to solve the task for the user. You MUST do your utmost best to finish the task and validate your work before yielding. If this mode is paired with `danger-full-access`, take advantage of it to deliver the best outcome for the user. Further, in this mode, your default testing philosophy is overridden: Even if you don't see local patterns for testing, you may add tests and scripts to validate your work. Just remove them before yielding.</permissions instructions>

**User**

You are a helpful assistant. You will be presented with a user prompt, and your job is to provide a short title for a task that will be created from that prompt.
The tasks typically have to do with coding-related tasks, for example requests for bug fixes or questions about a codebase. The title you generate will be shown in the UI to represent the prompt.
Generate a concise UI title (18-36 characters) for this task.
Return only the title. No quotes or trailing punctuation.
Do not use markdown or formatting characters.
If the task includes a ticket reference (e.g. ABC-123), include it verbatim.

Generate a clear, informative task title based solely on the prompt provided. Follow the rules below to ensure consistency, readability, and usefulness.

How to write a good title:
Generate a single-line title that captures the question or core change requested. The title should be easy to scan and useful in changelogs or review queues.
- Use an imperative verb first: "Add", "Fix", "Update", "Refactor", "Remove", "Locate", "Find", etc.
- Aim for 18-36 characters; keep under 5 words where possible.
- Capitalize only the first word (unless locale requires otherwise).
- Write the title in the user's locale.
- Do not use punctuation at the end.
- Output the title as plain text with no surrounding quotes or backticks.
- Use precise, non-redundant language.
- Translate fixed phrases into the user's locale (e.g., "Fix bug" -> "Corrige el error" in Spanish-ES), but leave code terms in English unless a widely adopted translation exists.
- If the user provides a title explicitly, reuse it (translated if needed) and skip generation logic.
- Make it clear when the user is requesting changes (use verbs like "Fix", "Add", etc) vs asking a question (use verbs like "Find", "Locate", "Count").
- Do NOT respond to the user, answer questions, or attempt to solve the problem; just write a title that can represent the user's query.

Examples:
- User: "Can we add dark-mode support to the settings page?" -> Add dark-mode support
- User: "Fehlerbehebung: Beim Anmelden erscheint 500." (de-DE) -> Login-Fehler 500 beheben
- User: "Refactoriser le composant sidebar pour réduire le code dupliqué." (fr-FR) -> Refactoriser composant sidebar
- User: "How do I fix our login bug?" -> Troubleshoot login bug
- User: "Where in the codebase is foo_bar created" -> Locate foo_bar
- User: "what's 2+2" -> Calculate 2+2

By following these conventions, your titles will be readable, changelog-friendly, and helpful to both users and downstream tools.

User prompt:
编写一个纯前端的页面，存放在web文件夹下，这个页面主要是展示功能，展示当前项目的每个git commit和与之关联的AI对话内容，所有的AI对话内容都存放在 @.waylog/history 文件夹下，通过对比每个git commit修改的这个文件夹下的Ai对话的内容，就能知道这个commit的AI对话，然后这样得出每个commit的AI对话历史，用直观的方式展示出来，可以方便每个用户点击任何一个commit查看这个commit的AI对话历史
